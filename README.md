# **SheapGamer RSS Feed Discord Bot**

This Discord bot automatically fetches the latest articles from a specified RSS feed and posts them to a designated Discord channel

This purpose to read RSS feed from SheapGamer channel but you can configure it
to read from any RSS feed your desired.

## **Features** :rocket:

* **Automated RSS Fetching:** Periodically checks a configurable RSS feed URL (default: https://rss.app/feeds/COiTZRnT26oDqrJf.xml) which is SheapGamer RSS
* **Persistent Tracking:** Uses a local last\_processed\_guid.json file to store the GUID (Globally Unique Identifier) of the last successfully posted RSS item, preventing duplicate posts across bot restarts.  
* **One-Day Filter:** Ignores any RSS posts that are older than 24 hours to prevent posting outdated content.  
* **Chronological Posting:** New items are posted in ascending order by date, ensuring the oldest new content appears first.  
* **Concise Discord Embeds:** Each new post is formatted as a Discord embed containing only:  
  * The article's **Title** (clickable, linking to the original article).  
  * The article's **Featured Image** (if available in the RSS feed).  
  * A **Timestamp** (from the RSS item's publication date).
